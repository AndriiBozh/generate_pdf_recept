I made this project to practice creating classes in Python.  
Used 'reportlab' to create .pdf file, 'pandas' to read and edit .csv file.  
User is prompted to input an index of an item, existing in .csv file.  
The program decrements a number of a product, whose index user provided and  
creates a .pdf file with a name of product
